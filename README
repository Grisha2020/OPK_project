The simplified task of the "Physics engine" project.
For this program, libraries are needed, such as tkinter, time, math, random, if you do not have them, then download (although almost all except tkinter are in the python program)
The game is called a "Tank".
This project is for fun.

To start the game, run the file called "Play_of_tank.py".

All changes indicated below should occur at the end of the file "Play_of_tank.py".

You can change the maximum number of targets (squares) by changing a variable named “MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_TARGETS”. It is advisable that the value you enter be of type int.

You can also change the time after which target will appear. To do this, you need to change the variable "TIME_RESPAWN_TARGETS".

You can change the cooldown between shots by changing the variable "TIME_RESPAWN_BULLET".

You can change the maximum speed of the tank by changing the variable "MAXIMUM_SPEED". It is advisable that the value you enter be of type int.

You can change the acceleration/deceleration of the tank by changing the variable "TANK_ACCELERATION". It is advisable that the value you enter be of type int.

You can change the speed of rotation of the tank by changing the variable "TANK_TURNING_SPEED", this variable should be indicated in radians.

You can change the rotation speed of the tank turret by changing the variable "TOWER_TURNING_SPEED", this variable should be indicated in radians.

You can resize the target by changing the variable "TARGET_SIZES".

You can resize the tank by changing the variables "TANK_WIDTH", "TANK_HEIGHT", "TOWER_TANK_SIZE", "GUN_HEIGHT", "GUN_WIDTH".

You can change the colors of the corresponding elements by changing variables with the subscript "COLOR_".

You can change the initial angle of the tank by changing the variable "START_ROTATE_TANK", this variable should be indicated in radians.

You can change the starting angle of the target by changing the variable "ROTATE_TARGETS", this variable should be indicated in radians. If you do this, targets will go out of the field, and the contact will not work correctly.

You can change the speed of the bullet by changing the variable "BULLET_SPEED".


Everything else is not desirable to change, although you can experiment
